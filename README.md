🙂 My Story:      
I am passionate about JavaScript and web technologies. Before the pandemic, I was just a struggling entrepreneur in the clothing industry.
'GARMENTIK' is a company where I hustled as a rainmaker. My business had its ups and downs, which were stressful, but I was learning 
 something new every day. During the pandemic, I decided to bring my passion into the business. Nowadays, two roles in my real-life game 
 are: Rainmaking for 'GARMENTIK' and 'Web Development Service'.  

👩‍💻 I Speak:
English, Bangla(Native), Taglish, and of course JavaScript!          

🎓 Certification:
I'm a Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) certified full-stack web developer   
on a journey of modern web mastery at the University of Helsinki.
